This Svelte project offers a dynamic way to explore employee data. It fetches information from an API, presenting it in a randomized order to avoid any inherent biases or ordering. This randomization ensures each time you load the page, you encounter a different arrangement of employees, promoting a more diverse and unbiased browsing experience.A gender filter allows you to refine the displayed employee list, focusing on specific demographics within the dataset. Furthermore, the inclusion of infinite scrolling means you can seamlessly navigate through the entire database without the limitations of traditional pagination.
